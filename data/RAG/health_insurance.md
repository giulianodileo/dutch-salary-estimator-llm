# Mandatory Health Insurance Cost (Netherlands)

## Overview

In the Netherlands, health insurance is mandatory. Every resident must have at least a basic health insurance package (basisverzekering). The cost consists of:

- A fixed monthly premium paid to the insurer.

- An income-based contribution collected by the government (via the Tax Authority).

- (Optional) An additional premium if you choose supplementary insurance.

## Monthly Premium (2025)

- Average basic insurance premium: €1880 per year → ~€157 per month.

- Premiums differ per insurer and policy.

- Children under 18: no premium.

## Income-Based Contribution

- On top of the monthly premium, everyone pays an income-dependent contribution.

- This is collected by the Tax Authority:

  - If you have wages or benefits → your employer or benefits agency pays the contribution (employer levy).

  - If you have other income (e.g., pension, early retirement scheme, alimony) → you pay the contribution yourself via tax assessment.

- The exact percentage depends on your income category (see “Zvw contribution rates” from the Dutch Tax Authority).

## Supplementary Insurance (Optional)

- If you add extra coverage (e.g., dental, physiotherapy), you pay an additional premium set by your insurer.

- No government income-based contribution applies to supplementary insurance.
