# Mandatory Health Insurance Cost (Netherlands)

## Overview

In the Netherlands, health insurance is mandatory. Every resident must have at least a basic health insurance package (basisverzekering). The cost consists of:

* A fixed monthly premium paid to the insurer.
* An income-based contribution collected by the government (via the Tax Authority).
* (Optional) An additional premium if you choose supplementary insurance.
* A mandatory deductible (eigen risico).

## Monthly Premium (2025)

* Average basic insurance premium: €1880 per year → \~€157 per month.
* Premiums differ per insurer and policy.
* Children under 18: no premium.

## Income-Based Contribution

* On top of the monthly premium, everyone pays an income-dependent contribution.
* This is collected by the Tax Authority:

  * If you have wages or benefits → your employer or benefits agency pays the contribution (employer levy).
  * If you have other income (e.g., pension, early retirement scheme, alimony) → you pay the contribution yourself via tax assessment.
* The exact percentage depends on your income category (see “Zvw contribution rates” from the Dutch Tax Authority).

## Supplementary Insurance (Optional)

* If you add extra coverage (e.g., dental, physiotherapy), you pay an additional premium set by your insurer.
* No government income-based contribution applies to supplementary insurance.

## Deductible (Eigen Risico)

* Adults (18+) pay a mandatory deductible of **€385 per year** for healthcare services from the basic package.
* You pay the first €385 of healthcare costs yourself before your insurer covers the rest.
* No deductible applies to certain care, including:

  * General practitioner care (including GP post)
  * Obstetric and maternity care
  * Prenatal tests (e.g., NIPT, 20-week ultrasound)
  * Integrated care for chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, COPD, CVR)
  * Community nursing
  * Follow-up checks and travel expenses for organ donation
  * Combined lifestyle interventions
* No deductible for children under 18.
* You can voluntarily increase the deductible by €100–€500, which lowers your monthly premium but increases your personal risk (e.g., max €885 if you opt for the highest voluntary deductible).
* Some insurers allow you to pay the deductible in installments.

### Important for Calculator

* The calculator only subtracts **fixed monthly premiums**, not deductibles, since deductibles are only paid when you use healthcare. This means actual annual healthcare expenses may be higher than the baseline calculation.
