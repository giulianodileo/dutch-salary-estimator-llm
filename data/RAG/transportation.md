## Car Costs Overview

Owning a car comes with many recurring expenses: fuel, road tax, and insurance, on top of the purchase price. Even a small second-hand car can cost a few hundred euros per month once you include maintenance. The overview below is based on a petrol car; costs like parking space rental or traffic fines are not included.

## Monthly Costs Breakdown

The data provided and the calculations show average costs per month for different car classes (mini, compact, small mid-size, mid-size), based on ten years of use and an average annual mileage of 8,500–11,000 kilometers. Fuel price used: €1.96 per liter (June 2024, ANWB; processed by Nibud in Dec 2024).

### Car classes explained:

How car classes are usually divided:

**Mini class**: the smallest cars, often city cars like Toyota Aygo or Fiat Panda.

**Compact class**: slightly larger, practical hatchbacks such as Volkswagen Polo or Ford Fiesta.

**Small mid-size**: family cars with more space, e.g. Volkswagen Golf or Renault Mégane.

**Mid-size**: larger family or business cars such as Volkswagen Passat or BMW 3-series.


### Fixed and Variable Costs

Fixed costs include depreciation, insurance, road tax, and routine maintenance, meanwhile variable costs cover fuel, repairs, and additional depreciation tied to mileage.

On average, total costs per month range from €351 for a mini-class car to €650 for a mid-size car. Cost per kilometer varies from about €0.50 to €0.74.

Fuel and depreciation, both strongly dependent on how many kilometers you drive. Maintenance and repair costs rise as the car ages, while insurance and taxes depend on the type of car.

For example, driving 8,500 km per year with a mini-class car leads to fixed costs of €193 per month and variable costs of €158.50 per month, totaling €351.50.

**Tips to save**:

Fuel is cheapest at discount stations, unmanned pumps, along B-roads, and within built-up areas.

Driving style directly impacts fuel costs — Milieu Centraal provides tips for fuel-efficient driving.

## New vs. Used Cars

New cars are more expensive than used cars because depreciation is highest in the first years. While older cars have higher repair and maintenance costs, these are usually outweighed by the savings from lower depreciation.

As an example, buying a four-year-old compact or small mid-size car and using it for another four years saves nearly 20% compared to buying a brand-new car.

## Alternatives: Car Sharing, Renting, or Public Transport

If you don’t drive much, owning a car is rarely the cheapest option. Car sharing or renting can save money, and Milieu Centraal provides detailed guidance on this.

Public transport is another alternative. When traveling alone, trains or buses can be significantly cheaper than driving, while group travel often favors the car. Exact trip costs can be checked via ns.nl or 9292.nl. Subscriptions may further reduce expenses.

### Notes

- Fixed car ownership costs (insurance, road tax) are not included in this tool.
- These figures are averages calculated by Nibud (National Institute for Family Finance Information), based on the data provided by ANWB (Royal Dutch Touring Club).
- Actual costs may vary depending on your car type, driving style, fuel prices, and personal situation. They should be seen as indicative, not exact for every car owner.
