# Transportation in the Netherlands

## Car Costs Overview

Owning a car comes with many recurring expenses: **fuel, road tax, insurance, depreciation, and maintenance**, on top of the purchase price. Even a small second-hand car can cost several hundred euros per month. The overview below is based on a petrol car; costs like parking space rental or traffic fines are excluded.

## New vs. Used Cars

* **New cars**: high depreciation in first years → most expensive to own.
* **Used cars**: higher maintenance costs, but depreciation is much lower.
* Example: Buying a 4-year-old compact/small mid-size car and using it for 4 more years saves \~20% vs a new car.

## Alternatives: Car Sharing, Renting, or Public Transport

* **Car sharing/rental**: cheaper if you drive infrequently.
* **Public transport**: often cheaper for solo travel, especially with subscriptions. Check ns.nl or 9292.nl for trip costs.
* Group travel may still favor car usage.
