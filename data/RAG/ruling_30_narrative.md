# The 30% Ruling in the Netherlands

## Overview

The **30% ruling (Expat Scheme)** is a Dutch tax benefit for foreign employees with scarce expertise who relocate to the Netherlands for work. It allows up to **30% of gross salary to be paid tax-free**, compensating for the additional expenses of working abroad. This reduces taxable income and increases net salary, but does **not increase gross salary**.

* **Duration:** up to 5 years (requires Tax Authority approval).
* **Cap (2025):** maximum untaxed allowance = **€73,800 per year** (salary ≥ €246,000).
* **Upcoming change:** percentage will reduce to 27% starting in 2027.

## Eligibility Conditions (2025)

* You must be **recruited from abroad** and employed in the Netherlands.
* You must possess **specific expertise**:

  * Annual taxable salary ≥ **€46,660** (2025).
  * If under 30 with a Dutch or equivalent master’s degree: ≥ **€35,468** (2025).

## Changing Employers

* Within the same corporate group: ruling continues automatically.
* New employer (outside the group): new application required within 4 months, ruling applies retroactively to start date if approved.

---

## Calculator Context

* The calculator adjusts disposable income by **reducing taxable salary** with the 30% allowance (up to the cap).
* Example: gross salary €100,000 → €30,000 tax-free → taxable income = €70,000.
* If the scheme applies only part of the year, the allowance is prorated.

---

## Key Takeaways

* 30% ruling = major benefit for expats, lowering taxable income.
* Eligibility requires minimum salary, expertise, and distance rules.
* Maximum benefit capped at €73,800 per year in 2025.
* Scheme length: up to 5 years, with reduction to 27% in 2027.
* Directly increases **net salary and disposable income** for eligible employees.
