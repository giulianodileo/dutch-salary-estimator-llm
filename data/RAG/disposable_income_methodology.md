# How Disposable Income is Calculated (Netherlands)

## Step 1. Input Collection

The calculation begins when the user completes the **necessary fields** in the calculator page (job position, seniority, location, household details, etc.). Each field is essential to determine:

* The starting gross salary
* Eligibility for the 30% ruling
* Applicable costs (housing, utilities, transportation)

## Step 2. Gross Salary Determination

* The **gross monthly salary** is **automatically retrieved from the Salary Calculator database**, based on the selected job position and seniority level.
* Users do **not** need to enter their own salary.
* Salaries in the database are always expressed as **gross monthly values**.

## Step 3. Adjustments

* Check whether the **30% ruling** applies, based on salary and other user-provided indicators.
* If applicable, reduce the taxable salary base accordingly (up to the cap).

## Step 4. Income Tax

* Apply the **progressive 2025 tax brackets** (Box 1: income from work and home ownership).
* **Important:** The calculator does **not** currently apply Dutch tax credits (arbeidskorting or algemene heffingskorting). This means results may be lower than actual official net salary.

## Step 5. Mandatory Monthly Costs

Subtract recurring household expenses:

* **Health insurance premiums** (basisverzekering)
* **Housing (rent)** based on user input or averages
* **Utilities** (gas, electricity, water) estimated by household size
* **Transportation costs** (car ownership if applicable)

## Step 6. Result

The remaining amount after deductions = **estimated disposable income** (monthly).

## Calculator Context

* The process combines **database salary benchmarks** with **user-provided details** to compute disposable income.
* **Disposable income** represents what is left for personal spending after taxes and essential recurring costs.
* This is an **estimation**, based on national averages and assumptions where exact user data is not available.
* Because **tax credits are excluded**, the estimate is conservative and may understate true take-home pay.
* Actual outcomes may differ depending on:

  * Individual rent and energy contracts
  * Insurance choices
  * Transportation mode and mileage
  * Additional or irregular expenses

## Disclaimer

This methodology reflects the logic used in the Salary Calculator app. It provides **indicative disposable income estimates** for the Netherlands in 2025. The calculator currently **does not apply arbeidskorting or algemene heffingskorting**, making results conservative compared to official tax outcomes. This should not be considered as formal financial or tax advice.
