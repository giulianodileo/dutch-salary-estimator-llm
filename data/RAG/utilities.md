# Utilities in the Netherlands (electricity, gas, and water)

In the Netherlands, gas, electricity, and water are recurring monthly expenses that households need to budget for.

## Gas

Gas is mainly used for heating the home, heating water, and sometimes for cooking. How much you spend depends largely on the type of house you live in rather than the number of people in it. The monthly bill covers your gas consumption, transport costs, and meter usage. Energy companies charge advance payments based on last year’s usage and the current rates, which can vary widely depending on the provider and contract type.

## Electricity

Electricity costs are more influenced by the number of people in a household and the appliances they use. On top of the standard price per kilowatt-hour, every household pays energy tax, though part of this is refunded each year through the “annual energy tax reduction.” Efficiency and choice of appliances play a big role in overall costs.

Many suppliers also offer green electricity or gas, generated from renewable sources such as wind or solar, which reduces CO₂ emissions. Comparison sites help weigh costs and options, but it’s important to check if a site is truly independent before relying on it.

## Contracts and Switching

Households often lock in their energy bills through fixed-term contracts. Canceling early can lead to compensation fees, as suppliers may face losses when reselling energy. Since June 2023, new rules apply to contract termination, making it even more important to calculate whether switching providers is financially beneficial before taking action.

## Water

Water costs are tied mainly to the number of residents in a home. Around a third of all water use goes into showering and bathing, with the rest spread across laundry, toilets, and cooking.

An eight-minute shower uses about 65 liters of hot water and costs around €0.52 with a gas boiler or €0.57 with an electric boiler. A full bath, at 120 liters, is roughly double that. Laundry costs also vary depending on wash temperature: a 30-degree wash averages €1.00, while a 90-degree wash is around €1.53. Drying clothes with a tumble dryer is even more expensive than washing, at about €1.54 per cycle.

## Saving Energy and Water

There are many ways to keep energy and water bills under control, even without big investments. Smart meters, thermostats, and apps can help track consumption, while organizations such as Milieu Centraal provide comparison tools and practical saving tips. Simple changes—like shorter showers, lowering wash temperatures, or air-drying clothes—can make a noticeable difference on the bill.
