# What is 30% ruling in the Netherlands
## General information about 30% ruling
The 30% ruling in the Netherlands is a tax benefit for foreign employees with specific expertise who move to the country for work, allowing up to 30% of their gross salary to be paid tax-free to compensate for the additional expenses of relocating and working abroad.The ruling is intended to attract highly skilled migrants whose expertise is scarce in the Dutch job market.Eligible employees can receive up to 30% of their salary tax-free for up to five years, provided certain conditions are met.The scheme does not increase gross pay but lowers taxable income, resulting in a higher net salary.30% facility applies to amounts up to EUR 233,000
### Purpose and Structure
The tax exemption serves as a reimbursement for extra costs incurred, such as travel, housing, permit applications, and language courses.For employment commencing after January 2024, the percentage will eventually reduce from 30% to 27% from January 2027.
### Eligibility Criteria
Must be recruited from abroad for a role requiring scarce expertise.Must meet a minimum salary threshold (set annually).Employee and employer must agree to the scheme in writing.
### Recent Changes
The previously proposed scaling down to a 10% tax-free allowance over five years has been reversed, and a flat rate of 27% will apply from 2027.Transitional rules exist for those already on the scheme before 2024.
