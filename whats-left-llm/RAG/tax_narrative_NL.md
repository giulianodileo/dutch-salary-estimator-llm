# Salary tax information in the Netherlands

## General Information
A salary in the Netherlands is subject to progressive income tax rates, divided into three brackets as of 2025. The tax system applies to residents' worldwide income and is primarily handled through payroll deductions by employers.
### Key Tax Brackets in 2025
Income up to €38,441: Taxed at 35.82%, which includes a portion for national insurance contributions.
Income from €38,441 to €76,817: Taxed at 37.48%.
Income over €76,817: Taxed at 49.50%.
### How Salary Tax is Calculated
Payroll tax is deducted directly by employers based on gross salary, applying the progressive rates depending on salary amount. Income tax (Box 1) considers income from work and home ownership, using the three-bracket structure.
Certain tax credits (like the general tax credit and labour tax credit) reduce the final amount payable, but these credits phase out as income increases. Residents are taxed on global income, while non-residents only pay tax on Dutch-sourced income.
### Other Key Information
Social security contributions are included in deductions for the lowest bracket, but not for higher brackets.
The Netherlands’ “box system” divides taxable income into three categories: Box 1 (salary/home ownership), Box 2 (substantial interests), and Box 3 (savings and investments). Salary falls under Box 1.

## Arbeidskorting (tax credit)
The arbeidskorting is a tax credit for people who work in the Netherlands, directly reducing the amount of income tax owed by employees and self-employed individuals.
### Purpose and Mechanism
The main goal is to make working more attractive, especially for lower and middle-income earners, by increasing their net earnings. The amount of arbeidskorting depends on annual employment income and age—higher credits for lower incomes, with the credit decreasing as income rises above a certain threshold.Employers automatically apply this deduction when calculating and withholding payroll tax each month, so workers receive the benefit immediately.
### 2025 Values and Thresholds
For 2025, the maximum arbeidskorting is €5,599 for income up to €43,071. As income rises above €43,071, the arbeidskorting is gradually reduced.

## Algemene Heffingskorting (tax credits)
The algemene heffingskorting is a basic tax credit in the Netherlands that directly reduces the amount of income tax and social security contributions owed, making it an important benefit for all taxpayers.
### How it works
Every Dutch resident who pays income tax is eligible for the algemene heffingskorting; it is automatically applied when salary is processed or tax returns are filed. The amount depends on total taxable income across all categories, including employment (Box 1), substantial interest (Box 2), and savings/investments (Box 3). For 2025, the maximum algemene heffingskorting is €3,068 for those with an income up to €28,406. The credit is gradually reduced for incomes above €28,406, reaching zero for incomes at or above €76,817.
The algemene heffingskorting ensures that taxpayers pay less tax, especially those with lower incomes, and it is a central mechanism to promote fairness in the Dutch tax system
